- chap3.v: i don't think will outperform baseline
- chap3_cut_example.v: 
  1) mcs will have more tokenized tactics, will outperform baseline
  2) we can also see if the input proof preprocessing improves performance
- chap4.v: not enough proofs
- chap5.v: can extract but not sure how much it outperforms baseline
- chap5_class.v: not sure how well it outperforms baseline
- chap6_exo_frac.v: should outperform baseline because branch dependency was encaptured by
                    mcs, and will benefit from graph pre-processing
- chap6_nth_length.v: should outperform baseline because of support for branch dependency and inner graph extraction
- chap8.v: should outperform baseline bacause of branch support
