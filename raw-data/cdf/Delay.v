(** The [delay] type and Capretta's partiality monad *)

(** The type [delay A] represents computations that produce a result
    of type [A] if they terminate, but can also diverge. *)

    CoInductive delay (A: Type) :=
    | now : A -> delay A
    | later : delay A -> delay A.

  Arguments now [A].
  Arguments later [A].

  Lemma u_delay:
    forall {A: Type} (x: delay A),
    x = match x with now v => now v | later y => later y end.
  Proof. destruct x; auto. Qed.

  Ltac unroll_delay X := rewrite (u_delay X); cbn.

  Definition ret := now.

  CoFixpoint bind {A B: Type} (d: delay A) (f: A -> delay B) :=
    match d with
    | now v => later (f v)
    | later d' => later (bind d' f)
    end.

  (** [safe Q d] means: if the computation [d] terminates,
      its value satisfies predicate [Q].  It's like a postcondition
      in a weak Hoare triple. *)
